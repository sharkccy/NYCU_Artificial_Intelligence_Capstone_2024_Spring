## Introduction
- In this project, we aim to experience the process of collecting data when building an ML model to solve a problem. The project involves web scraping, data 
  cleaning, and data organization to create a structured dataset suitable for training models.

- We collected 2773 car images from 20 brands to conduct experiments on fine-grained car classification with resnet18 and support vector machine. We also 
  performed clustering to explore the data we collected.
  
- See `110612117_project1_report.pdf` for more details.

## File Structure
- `assignment1-1.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for training and evaluating the ResNet18 model, support vector machine, and clustering on the collected car dataset.
- `helper/`: Directory containing helper codes for data scraping, cleaning, and organization.
